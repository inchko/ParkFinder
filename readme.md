ParkFinder is an App I made for my TFG. What this application does is basically communicate with a Firebase based API that informs where the user can find free parking spots. (And how many) in its nearby location.

It offers: 
 - Several ways to register:
	 - Google
	  - Email and password.
	  - More can be added easily.
- Ability to keep track of a zone while you are going to it. If in the time you spend going to the zone, it becomes busy, the app will send a notification. It can also send a notification if a previously full zone you are viewing becomes available. 
- Save your car's parking space.
- Display a route to the zone you want, or open it in Google Maps.
- Save locations important to the user (Home, Work) , and search for areas near those coordinates.
- Several languages:
	- English
	- English
	- More can be easily added.
	
The complete TFG can be found [here](http://hdl.handle.net/2117/353256)  (Spanish)

The API code is stored in a separate private repository.
